A few weeks back we had a hackathon with the idea of improving the aspects of our customer projects in different disciplines like unit testing, UI test automation, code quality, etc. The job of implementing a code quality check for our client-side code fell on me. I chose to use [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) for the task.
The idea I had was to integrate JSHint as a post build task when we run our automated builds in Jenkins and then once the build is done display the results of the quality check.
My idea was as follows: 
<br/>

1.  Install JSHint on [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com).
2.  Execute it once the build completes.
3.  Find a plugin to easily view results.

For the purposes of this tutorial I would be adding 

### 1.   Install JSHint on Grunt

Before JSHint is installed on Grunt, we need to install Grunt. Grunt runs a top of NodeJS, if NodeJS is not installed on your system, please download and install from [here](nodejs.org/download/).
Assuming the Node exists on your system, we move on to installing Grunt.
